<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Weather][product-screenshot]](https://mdyeates.github.io/weather-app/)

User Story:

- AS A traveler
- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Project Summary:

This weather dashboard makes it easy to stay on top of the latest weather conditions for your favorite cities. Using the reliable OpenWeatherMap API, you can search for a city and quickly see a detailed overview of the current weather, including the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. You'll also have access to a 5-day forecast that includes the date, weather icon, temperature, and humidity.

And when you search for a city, this dashboard will automatically adjust the theme to reflect whether it's currently night or day in that location, so you can easily view the weather at a glance. Plus, any city you search for will be saved in your search history, so you can easily access the weather conditions for that city again in the future.

When the page first loads, the dashboard will also use the web browser's geolocation API to determine your current location and display the weather for that location.

While working on this project, I gained valuable experience in accessing and retrieving data from RESTful web APIs using AJAX calls. I also learned how to process the returned data and use it in conjunction with JavaScript logic to generate dynamic page elements, enabling an application to display customized content based on the responses from the API.
